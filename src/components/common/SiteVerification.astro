/**
 * SiteVerification.astro
 *
 * This component renders Google Search Console site verification meta tags.
 * It enables website owners to verify their site ownership with Google Search Console
 * by adding a verification meta tag to the site's head section.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Conditional rendering based on site configuration
 * - Google Search Console verification support
 * - Automatic meta tag generation
 *
 * Configuration Dependencies:
 * - SITE.googleSiteVerificationId: Google Search Console verification token
 *   - Retrieved from site configuration
 *   - Only renders when this value is present
 *
 * Data Flow:
 * 1. Checks for SITE.googleSiteVerificationId in configuration
 * 2. Conditionally renders meta tag when ID is present
 * 3. Uses the verification ID as the content attribute value
 *
 * Usage Context:
 * - Included in BaseLayout for site-wide verification
 * - Renders in document head for search engine verification
 * - Provides site ownership verification for Google Search Console
 *
 * Security Considerations:
 * - Verification ID should be kept private
 * - Only renders when explicitly configured
 * - No user input processing
