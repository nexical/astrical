# Content Management Guide (AI Operations Manual)

This guide provides a comprehensive technical manual for programmatically managing all content within the Astrical platform. It is designed for an AI agent. The definitive source for all content structures, schemas, and component definitions is the `dev/content.spec.yaml` file. This guide serves as a human-readable interpretation of that specification, but the YAML spec file should be considered the ground truth.

The core philosophy of this project is **Content as Configuration**. All content, page structure, and site-wide settings are defined declaratively in YAML files located in the `content/` directory. The AI's primary role is to create, read, update, and delete the contents of these YAML files to manage the website.

## Core Concepts

- **One YAML File Per Page**: Each webpage corresponds to a single `.yaml` file within the `content/pages/` directory. For example, the content for the `/about` page is defined in `content/pages/about.yaml`. The filename (without the extension) determines the page's URL slug.

- **The /content Directory**: This is the root directory for all editable data. It is organized into subdirectories based on the type of content:
    - `content/config.yaml`: Global site settings.
    - `content/pages/`: Individual page definitions.
    - `content/menus/`: Navigation and link group definitions.
    - `content/shared/`: Reusable content components that can be embedded in pages.

- **Page Blueprint (sections array)**: The `sections` array within a page's YAML file acts as the blueprint for that page. It contains an ordered list of section objects, each defining a horizontal slice of the page. The order of these objects dictates the vertical layout of content blocks on the rendered page.

- **Content Specification**: The master schema for all content is defined in `dev/content.spec.yaml`. This file is automatically generated from the source code and serves as the single source of truth for validation and documentation. To update this file after making changes to component definitions, run `npm run generate-spec`.

## Site Configuration

Global site settings and navigation menus are managed in specific YAML files.

### Global Configuration

The primary site configuration is located at `content/config.yaml`.

**Schema**:

- `site` (object): General site information.
  - `name` (string): The display name of the site.
  - `organization` (string): The name of the owning organization.
  - `site` (string): The canonical root URL of the site.
  - `announcement` (string): HTML content for a site-wide announcement banner. Empty string to disable.

  - `trailingSlash` (boolean): If `true`, all URLs will have a trailing slash.
  - `googleSiteVerificationId` (string): Verification ID for Google Search Console.
- `metadata` (object): Default SEO metadata for all pages.
  - `title` (object): Default title settings.
    - `default` (string): The site-wide default title.
    - `template` (string): The template for page titles. `%s` is replaced by the page-specific title.
  - `description` (string): The site-wide default meta description.
  - `robots` (object): Default crawling directives.
    - `index` (boolean): `true` to allow indexing.
    - `follow` (boolean): `true` to allow following links.
  - `openGraph` (object): Default OpenGraph settings for social sharing.
    - `site_name` (string): The site name for OpenGraph.
    - `images` (array): Default images for sharing. See `Image` schema.
    - `type` (string): Default OpenGraph type (e.g., `website`).
  - `twitter` (object): Default Twitter card settings.
    - `handle` (string): The author's Twitter handle (e.g., `@organization`).
    - `site` (string): The site's Twitter handle.
    - `cardType` (string): The type of Twitter card (`summary` or `summary_large_image`).
- `i18n` (object): Internationalization settings.
  - `language` (string): The primary site language (e.g., `en`).
  - `textDirection` (string): Text direction (`ltr` or `rtl`).
- `analytics` (object): Analytics vendor configuration.
  - `vendors` (object): Container for vendor-specific settings.
    - `googleAnalytics.id` (string): Google Analytics ID.
    - `googleTagManager.id` (string): Google Tag Manager ID.
    - `facebook.id` (string): Facebook Pixel ID.
- `ui` (object): User interface settings.

  - **Schema**: `[{ text: string, href: string, links: [{ text: string, href: string }] }]`

- **Header Actions**: `content/menus/actions.yaml`
  - An array of CallToAction objects for buttons in the header.
  - **Schema**: `[{ text: string, href: string, variant: string }]`

- **Footer Navigation**: `content/menus/footer.yaml`
  - An array of link group objects, where each object represents a column in the footer.
  - **Schema**: `[{ title: string, links: [{ text: string, href: string }] }]`

- **Auxiliary Footer Links**: `content/menus/auxillary.yaml`
  - A simple array of links for the bottom-most part of the footer.
  - **Schema**: `[{ text: string, href: string }]`

- **Social Media Links**: `content/menus/social.yaml`
  - An array of social media links, including icons.
  - **Schema**: `[{ ariaLabel: string, icon: string, href: string }]`

## Common Data Structures

These are reusable data structures referenced by various components.

### Image

Defines an image with properties for source, alt text, and linking. For the complete schema, refer to the `Image` definition in `definitions` within `dev/content.spec.yaml`.

### CallToAction

Defines a call-to-action element, typically a button or a link. For the complete schema, refer to the `CallToAction` definition in `definitions` within `dev/content.spec.yaml`.

### Item

A generic content item used in lists and grids. For the complete schema, refer to the `Item` definition in `definitions` within `dev/content.spec.yaml`.

## Managing Web Pages

### Page Schema

Each file in `content/pages/` defines a single page. For the complete schema, refer to the `Page` definition at the root of `dev/content.spec.yaml`.

**Metadata Schema**:

The `metadata` object contains page-specific SEO and layout settings. For the complete schema, refer to `Page.properties.metadata` in `dev/content.spec.yaml`.

**Sections Schema**:

Each object in the `sections` array defines a horizontal section of the page. The `layout` property determines which section layout to use. For the complete schema of available layouts and their properties, refer to the definitions under `sections` in `dev/content.spec.yaml`.

### Component Schemas (The "API")

Components are the building blocks of a page, placed inside a section's `components` array. Each component is an object with a `type` key that determines which widget to render. The full ontology of available components and their schemas is defined under `components` in `dev/content.spec.yaml`.

#### Component Reference (Shared Components)

**Purpose**: Embeds a reusable component from the `content/shared/` directory. This is used to avoid duplicating content across multiple pages. Any property from the original component's schema can be included to override the value from the shared file for a specific instance.

## Content Strategy & AI Operations

This section defines the strategic rules for creating high-quality, cohesive content without human intervention.

### Standard Page Archetypes (Recipes)

Use these pre-defined layouts for common page types to ensure structural consistency.

- **The "Landing Page" Recipe**:
    1.  `Hero`: High-impact value proposition and primary CTA.
    2.  `Brands`: Social proof (logos of clients/partners).
    3.  `Features`: Core benefits grid (3-4 columns).
    4.  `Content`: Deep dive into the problem/solution (alternating `isReversed`).
    5.  `Testimonials`: Customer quotes.
    6.  `CallToAction`: Final push to convert.

- **The "Service Page" Recipe**:
    1.  `HeroText`: Clear statement of the service offering.
    2.  `Content`: The "Problem" statement (why this service is needed).
    3.  `Content`: The "Solution" (how we solve it).
    4.  `Features`: Specific deliverables or benefits.
    5.  `FAQs`: Addressing common objections.
    6.  `Form`: Lead generation form.

- **The "Directory Page" Recipe**:
    1.  `HeroText`: Introduction to the category.
    2.  `Features3`: Grid of sub-pages/items with images.
    3.  `CallToAction`: General inquiry.

### Copywriting Standards (Voice & Tone)

- **Benefit-Driven**: Headlines must focus on the user's outcome, not the feature.
    - *Bad*: "Workflow Automation Tool"
    - *Good*: "Automate your busywork and focus on strategy"
- **Conciseness**:
    - **Hero Titles**: Max 6 words.
    - **Subtitles**: Max 2 sentences.
    - **Feature Descriptions**: Max 150 characters.
- **Formatting**: Use **bold** text sparingly to highlight keywords in long content blocks. Never bold entire sentences.

### Shared Component Strategy (DRY)

The `content/shared/` directory is for reusable content blocks.

- **Rule**: If a block appears on more than 2 pages (e.g., a "Contact Us" CTA, a "Pricing" grid, or a specific "Testimonial"), it **MUST** be extracted to `content/shared/`.
- **Naming**: Categorize by type: `shared/cta/`, `shared/pricing/`, `shared/testimonials/`.
- **Usage**: Always prefer referencing a shared component over duplicating YAML.

### Visual Strategy

- **Hero Images**: Must be high-impact, abstract, or product-focused. Avoid generic stock photos of people shaking hands unless specifically requested.
- **Icons**: Use the **Tabler Icons** set exclusively. Ensure icons in a grid are thematically consistent (e.g., don't mix filled and outline styles).
- **Alt Text**: Mandatory for all images. Describe the image's function or content for accessibility.

### Site Structure Integrity

- **Orphan Rule**: Every new page must be linked from somewhere. Add it to `content/menus/header.yaml` or `footer.yaml` immediately upon creation.
- **Hierarchy**: Ensure the URL slug hierarchy matches the folder structure (e.g., `services/ai-consulting` should be defined in `content/pages/services/ai-consulting.yaml`).

## Visual Mapping & Asset Protocol

This section provides the rules for translating visual inputs (screenshots, mockups) into existing components and managing assets.

### Visual Pattern Library (Recipe Book)

Use this mapping to select the correct component based on visual patterns.

- **Pattern**: Large image with text overlay.
    - **Component**: `Hero` (with `bg` image).
- **Pattern**: Text on one side, image on the other.
    - **Component**: `Content` (use `isReversed: true` to flip).
- **Pattern**: Grid of icons with short text.
    - **Component**: `Features` (standard grid) or `ItemGrid` (horizontal alignment).
- **Pattern**: Grid of cards with images.
    - **Component**: `Features3` (image above text).
- **Pattern**: List of logos.
    - **Component**: `Brands`.
- **Pattern**: Step-by-step process with vertical line.
    - **Component**: `Steps` or `Timeline`.
- **Pattern**: Pricing tables.
    - **Component**: `Pricing`.
- **Pattern**: FAQ accordion.
    - **Component**: `FAQs`.

### Asset Management Protocol

When creating pages from screenshots where the original assets are not available:

1.  **Use Placeholders First**: Do not attempt to generate complex images immediately. Use the standard placeholders located in `public/placeholders/`.
    - **Landscape (16:9)**: `/placeholders/landscape.svg` (Hero backgrounds, feature images).
    - **Square (1:1)**: `/placeholders/square.svg` (Avatars, product shots).
    - **Portrait (3:4)**: `/placeholders/portrait.svg` (Team photos, vertical layouts).

2.  **Example Usage**:

    ```yaml
    - type: Content
      title: 'Visual Placeholder'
      image:
        src: '/placeholders/landscape.svg'
        alt: 'Placeholder for main visual'
    ```

3.  **Image Generation (Phase 2)**: Only after the structure is approved should you replace placeholders with AI-generated or stock images.

## Strategic Site Design (For AI)

This section provides a strategic framework for translating a user's request for a new website or a set of pages into a concrete content structure using the available layouts and components.

### Deconstructing a Site Idea

When a user provides a concept for a website (e.g., "a marketing site for a new SaaS product"), the first step is to outline the necessary pages. A typical marketing site includes:

1.  **Home Page (`home.yaml`)**: The main landing page. Its goal is to grab attention, communicate the core value proposition, and direct users to other key areas of the site.
2.  **About Page (`about.yaml`)**: Tells the story of the company, its mission, and its team. Builds trust and connection.
3.  **Services/Product Pages (`services.yaml`, `product-a.yaml`)**: Detailed pages explaining what is offered. Each major service or product might get its own page.
4.  **Pricing Page (`pricing.yaml`)**: Clearly lays out the costs and features of different plans.
5.  **Contact Page (`contact.yaml`)**: Provides a way for users to get in touch, usually with a form and contact details.
6.  **Blog/Resources Pages**: For content marketing. These are often managed separately or follow a different template.

For each page, determine its primary goal and the key information it needs to convey. This will inform which components to use.

### Process for Generating a Site Outline

To systematically convert a website idea into an actionable plan, follow these steps. The output of this process should be a clear site outline that you confirm with the user before creating any files.

1.  **Analyze the Core Request**:
    - **Identify the Subject**: What is the website about? (e.g., a law firm, a SaaS product, a personal portfolio).
    - **Identify the Goal**: What is the primary action the user wants visitors to take? (e.g., book a consultation, sign up for a trial, view a portfolio).
    - **Identify the Target Audience**: Who is the website for? (e.g., enterprise clients, small businesses, creative professionals).

2.  **Draft a Page List**:
    - **Start with Standard Pages**: Almost every site needs a Home, About, and Contact page.
    - **Add Content-Specific Pages**: Based on the subject, add relevant pages.
        - For a SaaS product: "Features", "Pricing", "Integrations".
        - For a service business (like a law firm): "Services", "Our Team", "Case Studies".
        - For a portfolio: "Portfolio", "Resume".
    - **Propose a Filename for Each Page**: Use short, descriptive slugs (e.g., `home.yaml`, `about-us.yaml`, `contact.yaml`).

3.  **Define Page-by-Page Objectives and Components**:
    - For each page in your list, create a brief outline.
    - **Objective**: State the page's primary goal in one sentence.
    - **Key Components**: List the essential components needed to achieve that goal. Use the component names from this guide (e.g., `Hero`, `Features`, `Testimonials`, `Form`).

4.  **Construct the Site Outline for User Approval**:
    - Format the information from the previous steps into a clear, hierarchical list. This is the "Site Outline" you will present to the user.

**Example Site Outline Generation**:

**User Request**: "I need a website for my new AI consulting business, 'Innovate AI'. We help companies build custom AI solutions. I want to showcase our services, our past projects, and get new clients to contact us."

**AI's Internal Analysis**:
- **Subject**: AI consulting business.
- **Goal**: Get potential clients to make contact.
- **Audience**: Businesses looking for AI solutions.

**AI's Proposed Site Outline (to be shown to the user)**:

Here is the proposed page outline for your website. Please review and confirm before I begin creating the pages.

- **1. Home (`home.yaml`)**
  - **Objective**: To quickly communicate what Innovate AI does and guide visitors to learn more or make contact.
  - **Key Components**:
    - A `Hero` section to state the main value proposition.
    - A `Features` grid to briefly list key services (e.g., "Strategy", "Development", "Integration").
    - A `Testimonials` section for social proof.
    - A `CallToAction` to encourage users to contact you.

- **2. Services (`services.yaml`)**
  - **Objective**: To provide detailed information about each of Innovate AI's service offerings.
  - **Key Components**:
    - A `HeroText` to introduce the services.
    - Multiple `Content` sections (one for each service) with text and possibly an icon or image.
    - An `FAQs` section to answer common questions about the services.

- **3. Case Studies (`case-studies.yaml`)**
  - **Objective**: To build credibility by showcasing successful past projects.
  - **Key Components**:
    - A `HeroText` introducing the portfolio.
    - A grid of case studies, likely using `Features` or `Content` components, where each item links to a detailed (future) case study page.

- **4. About Us (`about.yaml`)**
  - **Objective**: To tell the story of Innovate AI and build trust with potential clients.
  - **Key Components**:
    - A `Content` section with the company's mission and story.
    - A `Features` grid to introduce key team members with photos and bios.
    - A `Stats` section with company achievements (e.g., "10+ Years Experience").

- **5. Contact (`contact.yaml`)**
  - **Objective**: To make it easy for potential clients to get in touch.
  - **Key Components**:
    - A `Form` component for inquiries.
    - A `Content` section with other contact details (email, phone number).

This structured outline ensures clarity and alignment before any development work begins.

### Choosing Section Layouts

Section layouts define the high-level structure of a horizontal slice of a page.

- **`SingleColumn`**:
  - **Use Case**: Best for focused, full-width content that should draw the user's attention without distraction.
  - **Good for**:
    - Hero sections (using `HeroText`, `Hero`).
    - Centered, simple text blocks (`Content` component without an image).
    - Full-width showcases like `Pricing`, `Brands`, or `Testimonials`.
    - A prominent `CallToAction` section.

- **`TwoColumn`**:
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for presenting two related pieces of information side-by-side. This is a very common and versatile layout.
  - **Good for**:
    - Text next to an image (`Content` component with an image, `Steps`).
    - A list of features on one side and a contact form on the other.
    - Splitting content into a primary block and a secondary sidebar.

- **`ThreeColumn`**:
  - **Use Case**: Use when you need to display three distinct, equally important blocks of information across the page.
  - **Good for**:
    - Displaying three key services or benefits at a high level.
    - Footer layouts with multiple columns of links.
    - Less common for primary page content; `SingleColumn` and `TwoColumn` are usually more effective for readability.

### Choosing Components

Once you have a section layout, you populate it with components. Here's how to choose the right one:

- **For the Top of the Page (Introduction)**:
  - **`Hero` / `Hero2`**: Use when a strong visual (photo, product screenshot) is central to the message. `Hero2` provides a clean two-column layout.
  - **`HeroText`**: Use when the headline and text are the most important elements and an image would be distracting. It's direct and clean.

- **For Explaining Features, Services, or Benefits**:
  - **`Features` / `Features2`**: The go-to for listing multiple items with icons and short descriptions. They are excellent for quickly communicating value propositions. `Features` is standard, `Features2` has a slightly different visual style.
  - **`Features3`**: Use this when you have a list of features that are all related to a single, overarching concept that can be represented by one main image.
  - **`Content`**: Use when you need more than just a title/description, such as a full paragraph of text, a list, and a call-to-action, often paired with an image. It's for more detailed explanations than a `Features` grid.

- **For Building Trust and Credibility**:
  - **`Testimonials`**: The best choice for social proof. Display quotes from happy customers.
  - **`Stats`**: Use when you have powerful numbers (e.g., "Used by 10,000+ customers", "99% uptime") to make a convincing argument.
  - **`Brands`**: Showcases logos of well-known clients, partners, or technologies to build trust by association.

- **For Guiding the User**:
  - **`Steps` / `Steps2`**: Use to explain a process, workflow, or timeline. `Steps` is a vertical timeline format often paired with an image. `Steps2` is a two-column layout that's good for more detailed, numbered steps.
  - **`CallToAction`**: Use liberally to guide the user to the next logical action (e.g., "Sign Up", "Learn More", "Contact Us"). Every page should have at least one clear call to action.

- **For Answering Questions and Providing Information**:
  - **`FAQs`**: Perfect for proactively answering common questions. This can improve user experience and reduce support inquiries.
  - **`Note`**: Use for important asides, warnings, or special announcements that need to stand out from the main content.
  - **`Content`**: The workhorse for general informational content.

- **For User Interaction**:
  - **`Form`**: The only component for capturing user data. Use it for contact pages, lead generation, booking consultations, etc.
  - **`Pricing`**: Use specifically for displaying pricing plans. It has a dedicated structure for features, prices, and calls to action for each plan.

- **For Visuals**:
  - **`VideoPlayer`**: Use when a video (like a product demo or tutorial) is the best way to communicate a message.
  - **`Image` (within other components)**: Images are not standalone components but are embedded within others like `Content`, `Hero`, etc. Use high-quality, relevant images to support the text and make the page more engaging.

## Operational Workflows (For AI)

### Workflow: Creating a New Page

1.  **Create a new file**: `content/pages/your-new-page-slug.yaml`.
2.  **Populate the file** with the basic page structure.

    ```yaml
    metadata:
      title: 'Your New Page Title'
      description: 'A compelling description for your new page for SEO.'
    sections:
      - layout: 'Header'
        components:
          main:
            - type: 'HeroText'
              title: 'Title for the New Page'
              subtitle: 'A subtitle that explains the purpose of this page.'
      - layout: 'SingleColumn'
        components:
          main:
            - type: 'Content'
              content: |
                <p>This is a paragraph of text. You can use <strong>HTML</strong> tags here.</p>
                <p>Add more content as needed.</p>
    ```

### Workflow: Updating an Existing Page

**User Request**: "Change the title on the home page to 'Welcome to Our New Website'."

**AI Action**:

1.  Load the file `content/pages/home.yaml`.
2.  Locate the key path `metadata.title`.
3.  Change its value to `'Welcome to Our New Website'`.
4.  Save the file.

### Workflow: Adding a Component to a Page

**User Request**: "On the homepage, add a 3-column feature grid under the main hero section."

**AI Action**:

1.  Load the file `content/pages/home.yaml`.
2.  Locate the `sections` array.
3.  Find the first section object (which contains the hero). It will have `layout: 'Header'`.
4.  Inside its `components.main` array, find the `Hero2` component.
5.  To add a component *under* the hero but in a *new section*, insert a new section object into the `sections` array, immediately after the `Header` section.

    ```yaml
    # In content/pages/home.yaml, inside the 'sections' array:
    # ... after the first 'layout: Header' section object ...
    - layout: 'SingleColumn'
      components:
        main:
          - type: Features2
            title: 'Our Core Features'
            columns: 3
            items:
              - title: 'Feature One'
                description: 'Description for the first feature.'
                icon: 'tabler:star'
              - title: 'Feature Two'
                description: 'Description for the second feature.'
                icon: 'tabler:heart'
              - title: 'Feature Three'
                description: 'Description for the third feature.'
                icon: 'tabler:bolt'
    # ... rest of the sections ...
    ```

### Workflow: Updating Site Navigation

**User Request**: "Add a 'Blog' link to the main header menu that points to /blog."

**AI Action**:

1.  Load the file `content/menus/header.yaml`.
2.  This file contains an array of link objects.
3.  Append a new object to this array.

    ```yaml
    # In content/menus/header.yaml
    - text: 'Blog'
      href: '/blog'
    ```

4.  Save the file.
